\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Motivation: Two-way relay-HARQ MoDiv. HARQ first, then two-way relay
As an advanced technique to improve the robustness of high-rate wireless
transmissions against poor channel conditions, Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest
(HARQ) has found its application in various communication
systems~\cite{cripriano2010overview}. HARQ works on both PHY layer and MAC
sublayer to mitigate packet loss due to channel fading and
link-adaptation accuracy. Recently, substantial research interest
has been drawn to HARQ in Two-Way Relay Channel
(TWRC) [2-4].
In~\cite{iannello2009throughput}, the average throughput of naive Type-I HARQ
policy for both Amplify and Forward (AF) and Decode and Forward (RF) TWRC schemes have
been analyzed. The energy-delay tradeoff, and the diversity-multiplexing
tradeoff of type-II HARQ policy, also known as full Incremental Redundancy (IR),
for AF TWRC scheme have been studied in~\cite{choi2013energy}
and~\cite{xu2014diversity}, respectively. Related works about TWRC with ARQ
for different relay schemes and retransmission policies can also be
found in~\cite{popovski2007wireless, chen2012arq, guan2015twoway} and the references therein.

Apart from the naive Type-I HARQ and HARQ-IR, Type-I HARQ with maximal ratio
combining (MRC), also known as HARQ-Chase Combining
(HARQ-CC)~\cite{chase1985code}, is another practical HARQ
scheme supported by such standands as HSPA~\cite{TS25.308},
LTE~\cite{sesia2009lte} and so forth. As practical transmissions often admit
linear modulations of finite-alphabet constellation (e.g. Q-ary QAM), the
performance of HARQ-CC can be improved with Modulation Diversity
(MoDiv)~\cite{benelli1992new}, in which a same group of $\log_2Q$ bits are
mapped to different symbols in a same constellation in different round of (re)transmissions.
