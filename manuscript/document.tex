\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Motivation and literature review for Two-way relay-HARQ. HARQ first,
% then two-way relay
As an advanced technique to improve the robustness of high-rate wireless
transmissions against poor channel conditions, Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest
(HARQ) has found its application in various communication
systems~\cite{cripriano2010overview}. HARQ works on both PHY layer and MAC
sublayer to mitigate packet loss due to channel fading and
link-adaptation accuracy. Recently, substantial research interest
has been drawn to HARQ in two-way relay channel
(TWRC) [2-4].
In~\cite{iannello2009throughput}, the average throughput of naive Type-I HARQ
policy for both Amplify and Forward (AF) and Decode and Forward (RF) TWRC schemes have
been analyzed. The energy-delay tradeoff, and the diversity-multiplexing
tradeoff of type-II HARQ policy, also known as full Incremental Redundancy (IR),
for AF TWRC scheme have been studied in~\cite{choi2013energy}
and~\cite{xu2014diversity}, respectively. Related works about TWRC with ARQ
for different relay schemes and retransmission policies can also be
found in~\cite{popovski2007wireless, chen2012arq, guan2015twoway} and the references therein.

% Literature review on MoDiv for HARQ-CC
Apart from the naive Type-I HARQ and HARQ-IR, Type-I HARQ with maximal ratio
combining (MRC), also known as HARQ-Chase Combining
(HARQ-CC)~\cite{chase1985code}, is another simple and practical HARQ
scheme supported by such standands as HSPA~\cite{TS25.308},
LTE~\cite{sesia2009lte} and so forth. As practical transmissions often admit
linear modulations of finite-alphabet constellation (e.g. Q-ary QAM), the
performance of HARQ-CC can be improved with Modulation Diversity
(MoDiv)~\cite{benelli1992new}, in which a same group of $\log_2Q$ bits are
mapped to different symbols in a same constellation in different round of
(re)transmissions. MoDiv has been studied for
HARQ~\cite{harvind2005symbol}, relay
networks~\cite{seddik2008trans, khormuji2008rate} and relay-HARQ
systems~\cite{kim2009design, ryu2011ber}.

% What we are studying
In this paper, we study the MoDiv design for the TWRC under a simple AF scheme
and HARQ-CC protocol. We first derive an approximation for the uncoded bit-error
rate (BER) of TWRC-AF channel under the Rayleigh fading condition, given $M$
different mapping schemes corresponding to each (re)transmission. Based on this
approximation, we formulate a successive BER minimization MoDiv design into a
series of Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) in Koopmans-Beckmann (KB)
form~\cite{koopmans1957assignment}. Although QAP is NP-hard, efficient numerical
algorithms have been extensively researched~\cite{benlic2015memetic}, some of
which have shown extremely high performance over
QAPLIB~\cite{burkard1997qaplib}. We adopt a taboo search
algorithm~\cite{taillard1991robust} to solve each QAP in our formulation. Moreover, the coefficients of QAP problem can be also be computed efficiently in a
successive manner based on the solution to the preceding QAP problem. Our
numerical results demonstrate significant BER reduction over both non-MoDiv and
a simple heuristic MoDiv retransmission scheme for 16-QAM and 64-QAM
constellation, even under mismatching design parameters.

% Structure of the manuscript
The paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:model} introduces the
TWRC-AF model and the HARQ protocol we are using. Section~\ref{sec:modiv}
presents the successive BER minimization MoDiv design problem. In
Section~\ref{sec:numerical}, we present the numerical results to show the
performance gain of our MoDiv scheme. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}
concludes the paper.

\section{System Model}
\label{sec:model}

  \label{fig:model}
\end{figure}

% Two-way relay channel
Consider a TWRC with analog network coding (ANC) protocol~\cite{choi2013energy}, 
a generalization the AF protocol, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:model}. the relay
node $R$ is totally unaware of the HARQ procedure and simply performs ANC. Each round of ANC
transmission is composed of two phases. In the multiple access (MAC) phase, the
two source nodes $S_1$ and $S_2$ transmit to $R$ simultaneously. In the
broadcast (BC) phase, $R$ amplify and broadcast the signal received during the
MAC phase to both $S_1$ and $S_2$.
Denote the uplink channel from $S_s$ to $R$ and downlink channel from $R$ to
$S_s$ as $h_s$ and $g_s$, respectively, where $s=1,2$. We assume that all
the channels follow Rayleigh distribution, i.e.
$h_s\sim\mathcal{CN}(0,\beta_{h_s})$ and $g_s\sim\mathcal{CN}(0,\beta_{g_s})$,
$s=1,2$. Denote the transmitted symbol from $S_s$ as $x_s$ whose average power
$\mathbb{E}[|x_s|^2]=P_s$. Then the signal received by $R$ during the MAC phase
is
\begin{align}
  y_R & = h_1x_1+h_2x_2+n_R,
  \label{eq:y_R}
\end{align}
where $n_R\sim\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma_R^2)$ is the received noise at $R$. Assuming
that the relay $R$ has an expected power constraint of $P_R$, and that
$S_1$ and $S_2$ perform perfect self-interference cancellation (SIC), then the
received signal at $S_s$ after SIC is
\begin{align}
  y_s &= \alpha g_s y_R + n_s,\;s=1,2,
  \label{eq:y_s}
\end{align}
where $n_s\sim\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma_s^2)$ is the received noise at $S_s$, and
\begin{align}
  \alpha = \sqrt{\frac{P_R}{|h_1|^2P_1 + |h_2|^2P_2+\sigma_R^2}}
\end{align}
is the power normalization factor at $R$.

% HARQ protocol
On top of this settings, $S_1$ and $S_2$ performs the HARQ-CC protocol
in an unsynchronized manner. Consequently, the MoDiv design at $S_1$ and $S_2$
can be handled independently. Without loss of generality, we study the HARQ
transmission from $S_1$ to $S_2$. Denote $\mathcal{C}$ as the constellation used
by $S_1$ whose cardinality equals $Q=|\mathcal{C}|$. As a convention, during the
initial transmission of a packet, $S_1$ converts a bit sequence of length
$\log_2Q$ into symbols with Gray mapping $\psi_0:\{0,\ldots,Q - 1\}\rightarrow
\mathcal{C}$. The bit sequence is is labeled by its decimal equivalence $p\in
\{0,\ldots,Q - 1\}$. What distinct HARQ-CC with MoDiv from conventional HARQ-CC
is that, during the $m$-th retransmission, $S_1$ is allowed to use a
mapping function $\psi_m\not=\psi_0$ to remap the same label $p$. We assume
$m \leq M$ where $M$ is the maximum number of retransmissions. According to
Eq.~(\ref{eq:y_R})(\ref{eq:y_s}), the signal received by $S_2$ after SIC during
the $m$-th (re)transmission of $p$ is
\begin{equation}
  y_2^{(m)} = \alpha^{(m)} g_2^{(m)}h_1^{(m)}\psi_m[p] +
  \alpha^{(m)} g_2^{(m)}n_R^{(m)} + n_2^{(m)},
\end{equation}
where $X^{(m)}$ is the $m$-th realization of random variable $X$.

% ML detector
Assume that $S_2$ acquires perfect channel state information
(CSI). After the $m$-th retransmission, it attempts to demodulate the received symbols by
identifying label $p$ with $y_2^{(0)},\ldots,y_2^{(m)}$ via the maximum
likelihood (ML) detection:
\begin{align}
  p^* = \arg\min_p\sum_{k=0}^{m} \frac{|y_2^{(k)} -
  \alpha^{(k)} g_2^{(k)} h_1^{(k)}\psi_k[p]|^2}
  {\sigma_2^2+(\alpha^{(k)})^2\sigma_R^2|g_2^{(k)}|^2}.
  \label{eq:ml}
\end{align}

\section{Successive Constellation Mapping Design For Modulation Diversity}
\label{sec:modiv}
% Outline
In this section, we first derive an closed-form approximation of
the reception bit-error rate in our TWRC channel with HARQ-CC. Based on this
result, we formulate the BER-minimization MoDiv design into a successive
QAP (S-QAP).

\subsection{A BER approximation}
\label{ssec:ber}
% The approximation of BER using PEP
Assume that the label $p$ follows a uniform distribution. The BER of
the ML demodulator after the $m$-th retransmission can be upper-bounded and
approximated with the pair-wise error probability (PEP)~\cite{harvind2005symbol}:
\begin{align}
  P_{BER}^{(m)} = \sum_{p=0}^{Q - 1}\sum_{q=0}^{Q - 1}\frac{B[p,
  q]}{Q}P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p), \label{eq:P_BER}
\end{align}
where $B[p,q]$ represents the Hamming distance between the binary representation
of $p$ and $q$ normalized by $\log_2Q$, and $P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p)$ is the
probability that the ML demodulator prefer $q$ over $p$ conditioned on the
transmission of $p$. From Eq.~(\ref{eq:ml}), we have
\begin{align}
  P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p) = \mathbb{E}
  \left[Q\left(\sqrt{\sum_{k=0}^m \frac{(\alpha^{(k)})^2\epsilon_k[p,q]
  \gamma_2^{(k)} \delta_1^{(k)}} {2(\tilde{\sigma}_2^{(k)})^2}}\right)\right],
  \label{eq:PEP_m}
\end{align}
where $\gamma_2^{(k)} = \|g_2^{(k)}\|^2$, $\delta_1^{(k)} = \|h_1^{(k)}\|^2$
, $\epsilon_k[p,q] = \|\psi_k[p]-\psi_k[q]\|^2$, and $(\tilde{\sigma}_2^{(k)})^2
= \sigma_2^2+(\alpha^{(k)})^2\sigma_R^2\gamma_2^{(k)}$ is the instantaneous
variance of the noise received by $S_2$. By addopting the Chernoff upper bound
$Q(x)\leq e^{-x^2/2}/2$~\cite{proakisdigital}, an approximation to
$P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p)$ is
\begin{align}
  \tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p) = \frac{1}{2}\prod_{k=0}^{m} \mathbb{E}
  \left[\exp\left( 
  -\frac{(\alpha^{(k)})^2\epsilon_k[p,q]\gamma_2^{(k)} \delta_1^{(k)}}
  {4(\tilde{\sigma}_2^{(k)})^2}
  \right)\right].
  \label{eq:PEP_m_approx}
\end{align}
Although the Chernoff bound is a rather rough appoximation, it
enables efficient iterative computation of $P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p)$ as $m$ varies.
Moreover, as shown in Section~\ref{ssec:qap}, this approximation results in a
simple KB-form QAP. Nevertheless, the Chernoff bound can be replaced
with a more accurate approximation as in Eq.(14) of~\cite{chiani2003new},
As will be explained in Section~\ref{ssec:qap}, however, this will lead to a
more complex general-form QAP.

Denote $E_k[p,q]$ as the expectation in Eq.(\ref{eq:PEP_m_approx}), which can be
evaluated as follows:
\begin{proposition}
  An approximation to $E_k[p,q]$ is
  \begin{align}
    \tilde{E}_k[p,q] = \frac{4\sigma_R^2
    + \beta_{h_1}\epsilon_k[p,q]v\exp(v)Ei(v)}{u}
    \label{eq:E_k}
  \end{align}
  where
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
      u & = 4\sigma_R^2 + \beta_{h_1}\epsilon_k[p,q],\;
      v =
      \frac{4\sigma_2^2}{\tilde{\alpha}^2\beta_{g_2}u}, \notag\\
      \tilde{\alpha} & = \sqrt{\frac{P_R}{\beta_{h_1}P_1 +
      \beta_{h_2}P_2+\sigma_R^2}}, \notag
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
  and $Ei(x) = \int_x^\infty e^{-t}/tdt$ is the exponential integral
  function~\cite{zwillinger2014table}. 
  \label{prop:E_k}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  See Appendix.
\end{proof}
% Recursion of the approximated PEP

\subsection{The Successive Quadratic Assignment Problem}
\label{ssec:qap}
% Approximated BER minimization
Our MoDiv design is based on the approximated BER minimization criterion. As it
is impossible to know the number of actual retransmission $m$ in advance, we
formulate a sequence of $M$ optimization problems as
in~\cite{harvind2005symbol}, in which $\psi_m$ is optimized to minimize the
approximated BER given $\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_{m-1}$ without expecting future retransmissions. The
\begin{align}
  \min_{\psi^{(m)}|\psi^{(k)},k=0,\ldots,m-1}\tilde{P}_{BER}^{(m)},\,m=1,\ldots,M
  \label{eq:core}
\end{align}
where $\tilde{P}_{BER}^{(m)}$ denotes the approximated version of
Eq.(\ref{eq:P_BER}) evaluated with Eq.(\ref{eq:PEP_m_approx})(\ref{eq:E_k}).

% Successively approximated BER minimization in SQAP form
In order to rewrite Eq.(\ref{eq:core}) into a S-QAP formulation, we
denote $\mathbf{x}^{(m)} = \{x_{pi}^{(m)}|p,i=0,\ldots,Q-1\}$ as the
permutation matrix representing $\psi_m$:
\begin{align}
  x_{pi}^{(m)} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
        1,& \mbox{if $\psi_m[p] = \psi_0[i]$}\\
        0,& \mbox{otherwise.} 
   \end{array} \right.
\end{align}
Denote the constraint sets
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \mathcal{P} & = \left\{\mathbf{x}:\,\sum_{p=0}^{Q-1}x_{pi} = 1,
    x_{pi}\in\{0, 1\}\right\}, \\
    \mathcal{I} & = \left\{\mathbf{x}:\,\sum_{i=0}^{Q-1}x_{pi} = 1,
    x_{pi}\in\{0, 1\}\right\}. 
    \label{eq:constraint}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Then the MoDiv design problems in Eq.(\ref{eq:core}) can be formulated into a
S-QAP as follows:
\begin{align}
  & \min_{\mathbf{x}^{(m)}}\sum_{p=0}^{Q-1}\sum_{i=0}^{Q-1}
  \sum_{q=0}^{Q-1}\sum_{j=0}^{Q-1}f_{pq}^{(m)}d_{ij}x_{pi}^{(m)}x_{qj}^{(m)},
  \label{eq:SQAP}\\
  & \mbox{s.t. } \mathbf{x}^{(m)}\in \mathcal{P}\cap\mathcal{I}. \notag
\end{align}
in which the ``flow'' matrix $f_{pq}^{(m)}$ and the ``distance'' matrix $d_{ij}$
are defined as
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    f_{pq}^{(m)} & = \frac{B[p,q]}{Q}\tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m-1)}(q|p) \\
    d_{ij}  & = \tilde{E}_0[i,j]
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Note that here we assume all channel and noises to be stationary across all
retransmissions, so $d_{ij}$ only needs to be evaluated once. On the other hand,
$f_{pq}^{(m)}$ can be computed recursively along solving the S-QAP, since
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p) & = \sum_{i=0}^{Q-1}
    \sum_{j=0}^{Q-1}\tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m-1)}(q|p)d_{ij}\hat{x}_{pi}^{(m)}\hat{x}_{qj}^{(m)}
    \\
    \tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(-1)}(q|p) & = \frac{1}{2}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}^{(m)}$ is the solution to Eq.(\ref{eq:SQAP}). 

% Solution via Tabu search
In our S-QAP fromulation, each KB-form QAP is defined with two $Q$-by-$Q$
matrices, and only one of them needs to be updated. Should we adopt the more
accurate approximation~\cite{chiani2003new} in Eq.(\ref{eq:PEP_m}), each QAP
would be in general-form which is defined with one $Q^4$ matrix. Although this
4-dimensional matrix can still be updated iteratively using a few
$Q$-by-$Q$ matrices in a sequential manner, the solution to the general-form QAP
is ususally more complicated. With the S-QAP in KB form, we are able
to handle much larger constellation with an efficient robust taboo search
algorithm~\cite{taillard1991robust}. Other numerical approaches to
solve KB-QAP include simulated anneling (SA)~\cite{connolly1990improved},
ant-colony~\cite{gambardella1999ant} and so forth. Finally, we note that the
MoDiv design can be precomputed offline and stored in $S_1$ and $S_2$ as it
depends only on statistical CSI.

\section{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:numerical}
% Simulation settings
In our simulation, we consider a TWRC where the distance from $S_s$ to the relay
is $d_s$, $s=1,2$, thus $\beta_{h_s} = \beta_{g_s} = d_s^{\nu}$ where $\nu=3$ is
the path-loss coefficient. We also fix $P_1=P_2=0.5P_R=1$ and assume that
$\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2=\sigma_R^2 = \sigma^2$. In the HARQ protocol, we
select $M=3$. For the $m$-th
retransmission, we compare the performance of three MoDiv strategies: the simple
repeated retransmission without MoDiv (NM$m$), our QAP-optimized solution
(QAP$m$), and a heuristic MoDiv scheme where Gray-mapping and Seddik's heuristic
re-mapping~\cite{seddik2008trans} are used alternatingly for each
(re)transmission (GS$m$).

% Average uncoded BER and BER appxoimation of Non-MoDiv, Seddik, and QAP of for
% 64 QAM vs noise_power and d1
Firstly, we demonstrate the approximated and the Monte-Carlo simulated
total uncoded BER results of $S_1$ and $S_2$ for 64-QAM constellation. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:uncoded_noisepower}, we fix $d_1=d_2=0.5$ and plot the uncoded BER
against varying $\sigma_2$. In Fig.~\ref{fig:uncoded_position} by fixing
$\sigma^2=-12$dB and $d_1+d_2=1$ plot the uncoded BER against varying $d_1$. The
original transmission is labeled as TR0. For the 1st retransmission, both the
the QAP and the heuristic GS MoDiv offers about the same performance gap over NM
scheme. As $m$ increases, both the gap between GS and NM as well as that
between QAP and GS widens under various channel conditions.

\end{figure}

To further verify the performance gain and robustness of the
QAP-optimized MoDiv scheme, we compare the coded-BER of the three MoDiv schemes
in a LDPC-coded communication system based on~\cite{hochwald2003achieving}. We
use a LDPC code of length $L=2400$, coding rate of $3/4$ and a Monte-Carlo run of up to 2000 LDPC
frames. Since an important motivation of HARQ is to adopt for link adaptation
inaccuracies~\cite{cheng2006coding}, we deliberately optimize the remappings at
$\sigma^2=0dB$ for 16-QAM and $\sigma^2=4.5dB$ for 64-QAM and test their performances on
mismatching $\sigma^2$. Again we fix $d_1=d_2=0.5$. The results are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:coded_16QAM} and Fig.~\ref{fig:coded_64QAM}. Apparently, the QAP scheme offers larger performance gain for higher-order constellation. Specifically, even under
design mismatch, QAP2 achieves a equal or better performance than NM3 and GS3
for 64-QAM constellation.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we investigated the modulation diversity (MoDiv) design for
Chase Combining (CC) HARQ in amplify and forward (AF) two-way relay channel
(TWRC). With the objective of minimizing an approximated
bit error rate (BER), the MoDiv design was formulated into a successive Koopmans-
Beckmann Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) and solved with a robust taboo
search algorithm. Our numerical tests demonstrated that the QAP-optimized MoDiv
outperformed simple repeated use of Gray mapping and a heuristic MoDiv scheme
under various settings and was robust against mismatched design parameters.


\section{Appendix: Proof of Proposition 1}
\label{sec:append}
The proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:E_k} is generally based on Eq.(43)
of~\cite{han2009performance}. Firstly, by adopting the heuristic approximation
in~\cite{jing2006distributed}, the random variable $\alpha^{(k)}$ is replaced
with constant $\tilde{\alpha}$ in $E_k[p, q]$, then we have
\begin{align}
  E_k[p, q] & \approx \mathbb{E}_{\gamma_2}
  \left[
  \mathbb{E}_{\delta_1|\gamma_2}
  \left[
  \exp\left(
  -\frac{\tilde{\alpha}^2\epsilon_k[p,q]\gamma_2 \delta_1}
  {4(\sigma_2^2+\tilde{\alpha}^2\sigma_R^2\gamma_2)}
  \right)
  \right]
  \right] \notag \\
  & = \mathbb{E}_{\gamma_2}
  \left[
  \left(1 + \frac{\tilde{\alpha}^2\epsilon_k[p,q]\beta_{h_1}\gamma_2 }
  {4(\sigma_2^2+\tilde{\alpha}^2\sigma_R^2\gamma_2)}\right)^{-1}
  \right].
\end{align}
As $\delta_1,\gamma_2$ both follow exponential distribution,
