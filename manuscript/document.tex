% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code

% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Motivation and literature review for Two-way relay-HARQ. HARQ first,
% then two-way relay
\IEEEPARstart{A}{s} an advanced technique to improve the robustness of high-rate wireless
transmissions against poor channel conditions, Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest
(HARQ) has been widely adopted in various communication
systems~\cite{cripriano2010overview}. HARQ works on both PHY layer and MAC
sublayer to mitigate packet loss due to channel fading and
link-adaptation accuracy. Recently, there has been some research interests in
applying HARQ over two-way relay channel (TWRC) [2-4].
In~\cite{iannello2009throughput}, the average throughput of a simple Type-I HARQ
policy for both Amplify-and-Forward (AF) and Decode-and-Forward (DF) TWRC
schemes have been analyzed. The energy-delay tradeoff, and the diversity-multiplexing
tradeoff of type-II HARQ policy, also known as full Incremental Redundancy (IR),
for AF TWRC scheme have been studied in~\cite{choi2013energy}
and~\cite{xu2014diversity}, respectively. Related works on TWRC with ARQ
for different relay schemes and retransmission policies can also be
found in~\cite{popovski2007wireless, chen2012arq, guan2015twoway} and the references therein.

% Literature review on MoDiv for HARQ-CC
Apart from Type-I HARQ and HARQ-IR, Type-I HARQ with maximal ratio
combining (MRC), also known as HARQ-Chase Combining
(HARQ-CC)~\cite{chase1985code}, is another simple and effective HARQ
scheme supported by such standands as HSPA~\cite{TS25.308},
LTE~\cite{sesia2009lte}, among others. As practical transmissions often admit
linear modulations of finite-alphabet constellation (e.g. Q-ary QAM), the
performance of HARQ-CC can be improved with Modulation Diversity
(MoDiv)~\cite{benelli1992new}, in which a same group of $\log_2Q$
information bits are mapped to different symbols in a same constellation in
different round of (re)transmissions. MoDiv has been studied for
HARQ~\cite{harvind2005symbol}, relay
networks~\cite{seddik2008trans, khormuji2008rate} and relay-HARQ
systems~\cite{kim2009design, ryu2011ber}.

% What we are studying
In this paper, we study the MoDiv design for the TWRC under a simple AF scheme
and HARQ-CC protocol. We first derive an approximation for the uncoded bit-error
rate (BER) of TWRC-AF channel under Rayleigh fading channel condition, given $M$
different mapping schemes corresponding to each (re)transmission. Based on this
approximation, we formulate a successive BER minimization MoDiv design into a
series of Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) in Koopmans-Beckmann (KB)
form~\cite{koopmans1957assignment}. Although QAP is NP-hard, efficient numerical
algorithms have been extensively researched~\cite{benlic2015memetic}, some of
which have shown extremely high performance over
QAPLIB~\cite{burkard1997qaplib}. We adopt a taboo search
algorithm~\cite{taillard1991robust} to solve each QAP in our formulation. Moreover, the coefficients of QAP problem can be also be computed efficiently in a
successive manner based on the solution to the preceding QAP problem. Our
numerical results demonstrate significant BER reduction over both non-MoDiv and
a simple heuristic MoDiv retransmission scheme for 16-QAM and 64-QAM
constellations, even under mismatched design parameters.

% Structure of the manuscript
The paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:model} introduces the
TWRC-AF model and the HARQ protocol we are using. Section~\ref{sec:modiv}
presents the successive BER minimization MoDiv design problem. In
Section~\ref{sec:numerical}, we present the numerical results to show the
performance gain of our MoDiv scheme. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}
concludes the paper.

\section{System Model}
\label{sec:model}

% Two-way relay channel
Consider a TWRC with analog network coding (ANC) protocol~\cite{choi2013energy}, 
a generalization the AF protocol, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:model}. The relay
node $R$ is totally unaware of the HARQ procedure and simply performs ANC. Each round of ANC
transmission consists of two phases. In the multiple access (MAC) phase, the
two source nodes $S_1$ and $S_2$ transmit to $R$ simultaneously. In the
broadcast (BC) phase, node $R$ amplifies and broadcasts the signal received
during the MAC phase to both $S_1$ and $S_2$.
Denote the uplink channel from $S_s$ to $R$ and downlink channel from $R$ to
$S_s$ as $h_s$ and $g_s$, respectively, where $s=1,2$. We assume that all
the channels follow Rayleigh distribution, i.e.
$h_s\sim\mathcal{CN}(0,\beta_{h_s})$ and $g_s\sim\mathcal{CN}(0,\beta_{g_s})$,
$s=1,2$. Denote the transmitted symbol from $S_s$ as $x_s$ whose average power
$\mathbb{E}[|x_s|^2]=P_s$. Then the signal received by $R$ during the MAC phase
is
\begin{align}
  y_R & = h_1x_1+h_2x_2+n_R,
  \label{eq:y_R}
\end{align}
where $n_R\sim\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma_R^2)$ is the received noise at $R$. Assuming
that the relay $R$ has an expected power constraint of $P_R$, and that
$S_1$ and $S_2$ perform perfect self-interference cancellation (SIC), then the
received signal at $S_s$ after SIC is
\begin{align}
  y_s &= \alpha g_s y_R + n_s,\;s=1,2,
  \label{eq:y_s}
\end{align}
where $n_s\sim\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma_s^2)$ is the received noise at $S_s$, and
\begin{align}
  \alpha = \sqrt{\frac{P_R}{|h_1|^2P_1 + |h_2|^2P_2+\sigma_R^2}}
\end{align}
is the power normalization factor at $R$.

% HARQ protocol
On top of this settings, $S_1$ and $S_2$ performs the HARQ-CC protocol
in an unsynchronized manner. Consequently, the MoDiv design at $S_1$ and $S_2$
can be handled independently. Without loss of generality, we study the HARQ
transmission from $S_1$ to $S_2$. Denote $\mathcal{C}$ as the constellation used
by $S_1$ whose cardinality equals $Q=|\mathcal{C}|$. As a convention, during the
initial transmission of a packet, $S_1$ converts a bit sequence of length
$\log_2Q$ into symbols with Gray mapping $\psi_0:\{0,\ldots,Q - 1\}\rightarrow
\mathcal{C}$. The bit sequence is is labeled by its decimal equivalence $p\in
\{0,\ldots,Q - 1\}$. What distinct HARQ-CC with MoDiv from conventional HARQ-CC
is that, during the $m$-th retransmission, $S_1$ is allowed to use a
mapping function $\psi_m\not=\psi_0$ to remap the same label $p$. We assume
$m \leq M$ where $M$ is the maximum number of retransmissions. According to
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:y_R})(\ref{eq:y_s}), the signal received by $S_2$ after SIC during
the $m$-th (re)transmission of $p$ is
\begin{equation}
  y_2^{(m)} = \alpha^{(m)} g_2^{(m)}h_1^{(m)}\psi_m[p] +
  \alpha^{(m)} g_2^{(m)}n_R^{(m)} + n_2^{(m)},
\end{equation}
where $X^{(m)}$ is the $m$-th realization of random variable $X$.

% ML detector
Assume that $S_2$ acquires perfect channel state information
(CSI). After the $m$-th retransmission, it attempts to demodulate the received symbols by
identifying label $p$ with $y_2^{(0)},\ldots,y_2^{(m)}$ via the maximum
likelihood (ML) detection:
\begin{align}
  p^* = \arg\min_p\sum_{k=0}^{m} \frac{|y_2^{(k)} -
  \alpha^{(k)} g_2^{(k)} h_1^{(k)}\psi_k[p]|^2}
  {\sigma_2^2+(\alpha^{(k)})^2\sigma_R^2|g_2^{(k)}|^2}.
  \label{eq:ml}
\end{align}

\section{Successive Constellation Mapping Design For Modulation Diversity}
\label{sec:modiv}
% Outline
In this section, we first derive an closed-form approximation of
the reception bit-error rate in our TWRC channel with HARQ-CC. Based on this
result, we formulate the BER-minimization MoDiv design into a successive
QAP (S-QAP).

\subsection{A BER approximation}
\label{ssec:ber}
% The approximation of BER using PEP
Assume that the label $p$ follows a uniform distribution. The BER of
the ML demodulator after the $m$-th retransmission can be upper-bounded and
approximated with the pair-wise error probability (PEP)~\cite{harvind2005symbol}:
\begin{align}
  P_{BER}^{(m)} = \sum_{p=0}^{Q - 1}\sum_{q=0}^{Q - 1}\frac{B[p,
  q]}{Q}P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p), \label{eq:P_BER}
\end{align}
where $B[p,q]$ represents the Hamming distance between the binary representation
of $p$ and $q$ normalized by $\log_2Q$, and $P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p)$ is the
probability that the ML demodulator prefer $q$ over $p$ conditioned on the
transmission of $p$. From Eq.~(\ref{eq:ml}), we have
\begin{align}
  P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p) = \mathbb{E}
  \left[Q\left(\sqrt{\sum_{k=0}^m \frac{(\alpha^{(k)})^2\epsilon_k[p,q]
  \gamma_2^{(k)} \delta_1^{(k)}} {2(\tilde{\sigma}_2^{(k)})^2}}\right)\right],
  \label{eq:PEP_m}
\end{align}
where $\gamma_2^{(k)} = \|g_2^{(k)}\|^2$, $\delta_1^{(k)} = \|h_1^{(k)}\|^2$
, $\epsilon_k[p,q] = \|\psi_k[p]-\psi_k[q]\|^2$, and $(\tilde{\sigma}_2^{(k)})^2
= \sigma_2^2+(\alpha^{(k)})^2\sigma_R^2\gamma_2^{(k)}$ is the instantaneous
variance of the noise received by $S_2$. By adopting the Chernoff upper bound
$Q(x)\leq e^{-x^2/2}/2$~\cite{proakisdigital}, an approximation to
$P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p)$ is
\begin{align}
  \tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p) = \frac{1}{2}\prod_{k=0}^{m} \mathbb{E}
  \left[\exp\left( 
  -\frac{(\alpha^{(k)})^2\epsilon_k[p,q]\gamma_2^{(k)} \delta_1^{(k)}}
  {4(\tilde{\sigma}_2^{(k)})^2}
  \right)\right].
  \label{eq:PEP_m_approx}
\end{align}
Although the Chernoff bound is a rather coarse appoximation, it
enables efficient iterative computation of $P_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p)$ as $m$ varies.
Moreover, as shown in Section~\ref{ssec:qap}, this approximation results in a
simple KB-form QAP. Nevertheless, the Chernoff bound can be replaced
with a more accurate approximation as in Eq.(14) of~\cite{chiani2003new},
As will be explained in Section~\ref{ssec:qap}, however, this will lead to a
more complex general-form QAP.

Denote $E_k[p,q]$ as the expectation in Eq.(\ref{eq:PEP_m_approx}), which can be
evaluated as follows:
\begin{proposition}
  An approximation to $E_k[p,q]$ is
  \begin{align}
    \tilde{E}_k[p,q] = \frac{4\sigma_R^2
    + \beta_{h_1}\epsilon_k[p,q]v\exp(v)Ei(v)}{u}
    \label{eq:E_k}
  \end{align}
  where
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
      u & = 4\sigma_R^2 + \beta_{h_1}\epsilon_k[p,q],\;
      v =
      \frac{4\sigma_2^2}{\tilde{\alpha}^2\beta_{g_2}u}, \notag\\
      \tilde{\alpha} & = \sqrt{\frac{P_R}{\beta_{h_1}P_1 +
      \beta_{h_2}P_2+\sigma_R^2}}, \notag
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
  and $Ei(x) = \int_x^\infty e^{-t}/tdt$ is the exponential integral
  function~\cite{zwillinger2014table}. 
  \label{prop:E_k}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  See Appendix.
\end{proof}
% Recursion of the approximated PEP

\subsection{The Successive Quadratic Assignment Problem}
\label{ssec:qap}
% Approximated BER minimization
Our MoDiv design is based on the approximated BER minimization criterion. As it
is impossible to know the number of actual retransmission $m$ in advance, we
formulate a sequence of $M$ optimization problems as
in~\cite{harvind2005symbol}, in which $\psi_m$ is optimized to minimize the
approximated BER given $\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_{m-1}$ without expecting future
retransmissions:
\begin{align}
  \min_{\psi^{(m)}|\psi^{(k)},k=0,\ldots,m-1}\tilde{P}_{BER}^{(m)},\,m=1,\ldots,M
  \label{eq:core}
\end{align}
where $\tilde{P}_{BER}^{(m)}$ denotes the approximated version of
Eq.(\ref{eq:P_BER}) evaluated with Eq.(\ref{eq:PEP_m_approx})(\ref{eq:E_k}).

% Successively approximated BER minimization in SQAP form
In order to rewrite Eq.(\ref{eq:core}) into a S-QAP formulation, we
denote $\mathbf{x}^{(m)} = \{x_{pi}^{(m)}|p,i=0,\ldots,Q-1\}$ as the
permutation matrix representing $\psi_m$, in which $x_{pi}^{(m)} = I(\psi_m[p] =
\psi_0[i])$ and $I(\cdot)$ is the indicator function. Denote the constraint sets
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \mathcal{P} & = \left\{\mathbf{x}:\,\sum_{p=0}^{Q-1}x_{pi} = 1,
    x_{pi}\in\{0, 1\}\right\}, \\
    \mathcal{I} & = \left\{\mathbf{x}:\,\sum_{i=0}^{Q-1}x_{pi} = 1,
    x_{pi}\in\{0, 1\}\right\}. 
    \label{eq:constraint}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Then the MoDiv design problems in Eq.(\ref{eq:core}) can be formulated into a
S-QAP as follows:
\begin{align}
  \min_{\mathbf{x}^{(m)}\in \mathcal{P}\cap\mathcal{I}}
  \sum_{p=0}^{Q-1}\sum_{i=0}^{Q-1}
  \sum_{q=0}^{Q-1}\sum_{j=0}^{Q-1}f_{pq}^{(m)}d_{ij}x_{pi}^{(m)}x_{qj}^{(m)}, \label{eq:SQAP}
\end{align}
in which the ``flow'' matrix $f_{pq}^{(m)}$ and the ``distance'' matrix $d_{ij}$
are defined as
\begin{align}
  f_{pq}^{(m)} = \frac{B[p,q]}{Q}\tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m-1)}(q|p),\; d_{ij} =
  \tilde{E}_0[i,j]
\end{align}

Note that here we assume all channel and noises to be stationary across all
retransmissions, such that $d_{ij}$ only needs to be evaluated once. On the
other hand, $f_{pq}^{(m)}$ can be computed recursively while solving the S-QAP,
since
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m)}(q|p) & = \sum_{i=0}^{Q-1}
    \sum_{j=0}^{Q-1}\tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(m-1)}(q|p)d_{ij}\hat{x}_{pi}^{(m)}\hat{x}_{qj}^{(m)}
    \\
    \tilde{P}_{PEP}^{(-1)}(q|p) & = \frac{1}{2}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}^{(m)}$ is the solution to Eq.(\ref{eq:SQAP}). 

% Solution via Tabu search
In our S-QAP fromulation, each KB-form QAP is defined with two $Q$-by-$Q$
matrices, only one of which needs to be updated. Should we adopt the more
accurate approximation~\cite{chiani2003new} in Eq.(\ref{eq:PEP_m}), each QAP
would be in general-form which is defined with one $Q^4$ matrix. Although this
4-dimensional matrix can still be updated iteratively using a few
$Q$-by-$Q$ matrices in a sequential manner, the solution to the general-form QAP
is ususally more complicated. With the S-QAP in KB form, we are able
to handle much larger constellation with an efficient robust tabu search
algorithm~\cite{taillard1991robust}. The tabu search heuristic
yields slight overestimates or upper bounds of the optimal objective values. To
shed some light on this we computed the lower bounds based an semidefinite
programming relaxations as in~\cite{wu2011computation}. Typically the gap
between lower and upper bounds is on the order of 10-20\% with the exact
objective value being much closer to the upper bound.Finally, we note that the
MoDiv design can be precomputed offline and stored in $S_1$ and $S_2$ as it depends only on
statistical CSI.

\section{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:numerical}
% Simulation settings
In our simulation, we consider a TWRC where the distance from $S_s$ to the relay
is $d_s$, $s=1,2$, thus $\beta_{h_s} = \beta_{g_s} = d_s^{\nu}$ where $\nu=3$ is
the path-loss coefficient. We also fix $P_1=P_2=0.5P_R=1$ and assume that
$\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2=\sigma_R^2 = \sigma^2$. In the HARQ protocol, we
select $M=3$. For the $m$-th
retransmission, we compare the performance of three MoDiv strategies: the simple
repeated retransmission without MoDiv, our QAP-optimized solution, and a
heuristic MoDiv scheme where Gray-mapping and Seddik's heuristic
re-mapping~\cite{seddik2008trans} are used alternatingly for each
(re)transmission (GS$m$). In our simulation results, the performance of the
above three schemes after the $m$-th retransmission are labeled as NM$m$, QAP$m$
and GS$m$, respectively and that of the original transmission using Gray mapping
is labeled as TR0.

% Average uncoded BER and BER appxoimation of Non-MoDiv, Seddik, and QAP of for
% 64 QAM vs noise_power and d1
Firstly, we demonstrate the approximated and the Monte-Carlo simulated
uncoded BER results of $S_1$ and $S_2$ for 64-QAM constellation. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:uncoded_noisepower}, we fix $d_1=d_2=0.5$ and plot the uncoded BER
against varying $\sigma^2$. For the
first retransmission, both the the QAP and the heuristic GS MoDiv offers about
the same performance gap over NM scheme. However, as $m$ increases, both the gap
between GS and NM as well as that between QAP and GS widens.

  \caption{Uncoded BER vs $\sigma^2$ for 64-QAM.}
  \label{fig:uncoded_noisepower}
\end{figure}

To further verify the performance gain and robustness of the
QAP-optimized MoDiv scheme, we compare the coded-BER of the three MoDiv schemes
in a LDPC-coded communication system based on~\cite{hochwald2003achieving}. We
use a LDPC code of length $L=2400$, coding rate of $3/4$ and a Monte-Carlo run of up to 2000 LDPC
frames. Since an important motivation of HARQ is to adopt for link adaptation
inaccuracies~\cite{cheng2006coding}, we deliberately optimize the remappings at
$\sigma^2=0dB$ for 16-QAM and $\sigma^2=4.5dB$ for 64-QAM and test their performances on
mismatching $\sigma^2$. Again we fix $d_1=d_2=0.5$. The results are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:coded_16QAM} and Fig.~\ref{fig:coded_64QAM}. Apparently, the QAP scheme offers larger performance gain for higher-order constellation. Specifically, even under
design mismatch, QAP2 achieves a equal or better performance than NM3 and GS3
for 64-QAM constellation.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we investigated the modulation diversity (MoDiv) design for
Chase Combining (CC) HARQ in amplify and forward (AF) two-way relay channel
(TWRC). With the objective of minimizing an approximated
bit error rate (BER), the MoDiv design was formulated into a successive
Koopmans-Beckmann Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) and solved with a robust
taboo search algorithm. Our numerical tests demonstrated that the QAP-optimized
MoDiv outperformed simple repeated use of Gray mapping and a heuristic MoDiv
scheme under various settings and was robust against mismatched design parameters.

\appendix[Proof of Proposition 1]
\label{sec:append}
The proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:E_k} is generally based on Eq.(43)
of~\cite{han2009performance}. Firstly, by adopting the heuristic approximation
in~\cite{jing2006distributed}, the random variable $\alpha^{(k)}$ is replaced
with constant $\tilde{\alpha}$ in $E_k[p, q]$, then we have
\begin{align}
  E_k[p, q] & \approx \mathbb{E}_{\gamma_2}
  \left[
  \mathbb{E}_{\delta_1|\gamma_2}
  \left[
  \exp\left(
  -\frac{\tilde{\alpha}^2\epsilon_k[p,q]\gamma_2 \delta_1}
  {4(\sigma_2^2+\tilde{\alpha}^2\sigma_R^2\gamma_2)}
  \right)
  \right]
  \right] \notag \\
  & = \mathbb{E}_{\gamma_2}
  \left[
  \left(1 + \frac{\tilde{\alpha}^2\epsilon_k[p,q]\beta_{h_1}\gamma_2 }
  {4(\sigma_2^2+\tilde{\alpha}^2\sigma_R^2\gamma_2)}\right)^{-1}
  \right]. \label{eq:ekpq_approx}
\end{align}
As $\delta_1,\gamma_2$ both follow exponential distribution,
Eq.(\ref{eq:E_k}) is derived by evaluating Eq.(\ref{eq:ekpq_approx}) with
Eq.(3.352.4) of~\cite{zwillinger2014table}.
